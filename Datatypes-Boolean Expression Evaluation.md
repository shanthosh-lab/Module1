# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `0 == True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `False == False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + 3`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 7`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## ðŸ’» Program
a = (1 == True)

b = (0== False)

c = True + 3

d = False + 7

print(f"a is {a}")
print(f"b is {b}")
print(f"c: {c}")
print(f"d: {d}")

## Result
Thus, a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`is verified.
